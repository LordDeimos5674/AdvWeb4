This is a Nodejs website, suppose to be pretty simple the way you would test it was by
Go to replit.com
Create a new repl
Enter the url for your submission github repo and click “Import from GitHub”
Change the language to Node.js
Click the “Run” button and you should get the URL to your demo in the URL bar of the repl’s web view.

buttttt, Replit swapped to a non free model so all I can do is tell you how to run it locally

1st you want to download all the files and when you run index.js make sure you select to run it through node.js
then you want to open your browser of choice and type in, http://localhost:8080 this should take you to the main page
then to see the about me and contact me go through http://localhost:8080/about and http://localhost:8080/contact-me respectfully
finally if you were to type in http://localhost:8080/(insert random words here) it would take you to a 404 error code
once again sorry that replit decided to change their buisness model
